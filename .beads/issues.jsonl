Based on Kilo-Code's implementation that embeds tool definitions in system prompts and parses XML responses.","notes":"Successfully implemented XML-based tool calling for universal model compatibility. Created xml-tool-formatter.js for generating XML tool instructions and xml-tool-parser.js for parsing XML responses. Updated index.js to use XML approach instead of native tool calling. Fixed all tests including XML parser tests (17/17 passing) and updated streaming tool calls test to work with XML format. Added grok provider support to key-resolver.js. All 25 tests now passing. Packaged new VSIX (claude-throne-1.4.3.vsix, 635.03KB) with XML tool calling functionality included. XML approach supports problematic models like deepseek/deepseek-chat:free, qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b:free, and GPT-5-codex that previously failed with native tool calling.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-16T17:48:18.309906-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-17T16:38:08.771537-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T16:09:33.317782-07:00"}
